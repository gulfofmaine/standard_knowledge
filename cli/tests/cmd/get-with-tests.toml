"Height_above_X" means the vertical distance above the named surface X. "Sea surface height" is a time-varying quantity. The "geopotential datum" is any estimated surface of constant geopotential used as a datum i.e. a reference level; for the geoid as a datum, specific standard names are available. To specify which geoid or geopotential datum is being used as a reference level, a grid_mapping variable should be attached to the data variable as described in Chapter 5.6 of the CF Convention.
